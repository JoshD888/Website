### Bio

I'm a skilled Computer Science and Statistics student at Wake Forest University, with a particular focus on High Performance Computing (HPC), Machine Learning, Multivariate Analysis, and other key subjects. As an Undergraduate Research Assistant at Wake Forest IRSC Laboratory, I apply deep learning methodologies and quantitative techniques to intricate computer vision projects, involving semantic segmentation, object classification, and image data processing.

If you want to cooperate or join my research group, please contact me with my email or my mentors via emails in "Research".
